# Recipe

Recipe is a generic approach
to transform existing CFT protocols to tolerate Byzantine failures
in untrusted cloud environments. Recipe leverages advances in
confidential computing and direct network I/O to guarantee non-
equivocation and transferable authentication in the presence of
Byzantine actors, while offering performance and resource over-
heads on par with CFT protocols. Recipeâ€™s APIs are generic and can
be adapted to existing codebases


You can find more details in our [Middleware'25 paper](TBA).
